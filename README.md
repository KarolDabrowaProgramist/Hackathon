# Hackathon
First Hackathon
Gra wisielec
The code starts with saying hello, introducing the rules of the game and how many tries the user has to use.
A word is randomly selected from the list I have prepared.
With each incorrect attempt to guess a letter in a word, the number of attempts decreases. 
When the counter drops to 0, the game thanks the user and displays the drawn word. 
If the user guesses a letter, the number of tries does not decrease.
